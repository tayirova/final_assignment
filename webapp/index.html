    <h1>Uzbekistan Cities</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Samarkand</h2>

        <p>
            Best for dramatic architecture. The historic Registan Square in Samarkand impresses first-time visitors more than any other attraction in Uzbekistan. Included on the UNESCO World Heritage list, the square consists of three striking medressas – the Ulugbek, Sherdor and Tilla-Kori – which together served as a university for Islamic scholars. The name Registan means "a sand place". Since the Timurid period, this has been a place where people have met, important decisions were announced, and crucial events in Uzbekistan’s history occurred. Samarkand is blessed with many other historical attractions, including the Bibi-Khanym Mosque, the Shah-i-Zinda Necropolis, the Gur-e-Amir mausoleum and Ulugbek’s Observatory – all of them well worth visiting. One day might be enough to cover most important stops, but if you want to enjoy the pace of life in Samarkand, wander around talking to local craftspeople and leave some time for tea and local cuisine, allow two days or more.

        <h2>Bukhara</h2>
        <img src="/static/bukhara.jpg" alt="Bukhara">
        <p>
           In Samarkand, an ancient mosque might sit alongside an office tower or a modern neighborhood, but Bukhara’s old city really makes you travel in time. Protected by UNESCO, the historical part of the city still feels completely authentic, with timeless mosques, minarets, medressas, craft workshops, caravanserais and local eateries. Set around an artificial pool called Labi Hovuz, the central square has a unique atmosphere and is a great place to admire the architecture, enjoy local food, sip tea, slurp ice cream, bargain with souvenir sellers, or just have a breather sitting on a bench in the sun. There are many must-visit stops in Bukhara. Be sure to make time for the Ark, a former residence of Bukhara Emir, the eye-catching medressas of Mir-i-Arab, Nadir Divanbegi and Abdul Aziz Khan, the Kalon Minaret, and the inspiring Sitorai Mohi Hosa summer palace. While the old city might seem compact on the map, Bukhara deserves at least two full days. This is one of those cities where you can discover endless new layers each time you return.

        <h2>Khiva</h2>
        <img src="/static/khiva.jpg" alt="Khiva">
        <p>
            The open-air museum that is the city of Khiva used to be the capital of the Khorezm Shakhs and later the hub of the Khiva Khanate, and it still preserves its own language, traditions and culture. The fascinating Ichan Kala (which means “inner city”) is the fortress in the heart of Khiva, and most of the architectural attractions are located inside of it. Visit the atmospheric Juma mosque, the Tosh-Hovli Palace (with its harem rooms for wives of the ruler), and the Kalta Minor minaret, and you’ll feel the grandeur and tranquility of Central Asia in the Middle Ages. Some of the historic buildings have been transformed into boutique hotels – it’s a very unusual feeling to stay overnight in a room of medieval features, but with all the modern facilities you could want, such as air-conditioning and a hot shower. Get to know the culture of Khiva through classes, from baking bread all the way to lessons in energetic Khorezm dancing.
